## ðŸ”’ Spotify credentials to run the project locally

You must have a [** developer account on Spotify **](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) (creating this account is completely free and you can use your own Spotify account).

After creating your account, just click on the ** CREATE AN APP ** button and fill in the requested data.

After that, you will have access to your application's Dashboard. On the left side will be your credentials, such as the Client ID, which will be used to fill the frontend's .env file.

Finally, on the right side click on the **EDIT SETTINGS** button. In the modal that opens there will be a component called **Redirects URIs**, in it you will fill in the URL where the project will be running with the route **/login** (Ex: http://localhost:3333/login) . Don't forget to save your changes!
